Now coming to the Nvidia revenue by segment for year 2020 and 2025
This chart powerfully illustrates the dramatic shift in NVIDIA's business between 2020 and 2025, highlighting where its explosive growth has come from.

In 2020 (blue bars), NVIDIA's revenue was more evenly distributed across its segments, with Data Center and Gaming being comparable. Fast forward to 2025 (green bars), and the picture is completely different. The company's revenue has skyrocketed, and it's almost entirely driven by one segment.

Software Stack

So, we've seen where NVIDIA's money comes from, but the real story is their software. This is why we call NVIDIA a ‘software company in disguise.’

It all starts with CUDA, their foundational programming model. Every major AI framework—like TensorFlow and PyTorch—is built on it. On top, specialized libraries like cuDNN and TensorRT make AI training and inference incredibly fast.

This combination creates a powerful performance lock-in.

They've built an impenetrable software moat around their hardware, locking in developers, researchers, and entire industries. Higher-level platforms like NVIDIA AI Enterprise and Omniverse only deepen this moat, turning them into an enterprise software provider, not just a chip seller.

This is why competitors like AMD and Intel can't catch up. Even if they build a comparable chip, they don't have this decade-plus software advantage.

Think about it: for OpenAI to train GPT-5, they can't just swap to AMD chips. They’d have to rewrite their entire software pipeline, costing them critical time, money, and performance. That's the lock-in, and that's NVIDIA's true, sustainable advantage.

TIMELINE

NVIDIA introduces CUDA — a new programming model for unlocking the parallel computing power of GPUs
First general-purpose GPU computing platform
The seed that would later dominate AI

Of course. Here is a cohesive timeline that tells the story of CUDA's rise, presented in a synchronous style for your presentation.

***

### **2012: The Spark of the Revolution**

This is the "big bang" moment. The AlexNet neural network wins the ImageNet competition by a landslide, using NVIDIA GPUs. Suddenly, deep learning isn't just a theoretical concept; it's a practical, world-beating technology. This victory, made possible by the speed of **CUDA** and **cuDNN**, ignites the deep learning explosion and establishes NVIDIA's software as the essential tool for anyone serious about AI.

---

### **2014-2016: The Foundation Sets**

The revolution gains unstoppable momentum. The world's most important AI frameworks—**TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe**—are all built with CUDA as their default backend. The choice is clear: if you want performance, you build on NVIDIA. An entire ecosystem, including specialized libraries like **NCCL** and **TensorRT**, flourishes on top of CUDA. Developers begin writing their models specifically for this ecosystem, and the **lock-in deepens** from a preference into a dependency.

---

### **2020: The Commercial Engine**

NVIDIA evolves from a hardware seller to an enterprise solutions provider. With the launch of the **NVIDIA AI Enterprise** software suite and **DGX Cloud**, they package their entire stack into a product for Fortune 500 companies. CUDA is no longer just a tool for researchers; it's now the trusted, commercial infrastructure powering large-scale AI deployments at tech giants like **OpenAI and Meta**.

---

### **2023: The Generative AI Tsunami**

The world is introduced to **ChatGPT**. This cultural and technological phenomenon, along with the global LLM race it triggers, runs almost exclusively on NVIDIA's A100 and H100 GPUs. CUDA is the invisible engine powering every viral AI image and every mind-blowing chatbot response. This centrality to the AI boom causes NVIDIA's data center revenue to explode, cementing its position as the indispensable provider for modern AI.

---

### **2025: The Unquestioned Backbone of AI**

Today, the story reaches its current peak. **CUDA commands an estimated 80-90% of the AI market**. Competitors like AMD's ROCm and Intel's OneAPI are not serious contenders; they remain niche solutions in a world built on CUDA. There is simply no viable, large-scale AI stack that exists without it.

What started as a tool to program GPUs has become something far more profound. **CUDA is now the fundamental backbone of modern artificial intelligence.**

Google Scholar

This chart reflects the reality for developers today — CUDA completely dominates in developer mindshare. With over 57,000 results, it dwarfs OpenCL and AMD's ROCm.

That number isn’t just about code — it signals a vast community, endless resources, and easier debugging.

The takeaway? NVIDIA’s moat isn’t just technical — it’s a knowledge and community advantage. Developers stick with CUDA not just because it’s powerful, but because it’s safe. Anything else feels like a risk.

NVIDIA vs AMD vs INTEL Difference

That huge gap in developer support isn’t accidental — it’s the result of very different strategies over a decade.

On hardware, the race looks close. All three—NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel—make strong chips. But in AI, software wins the race.

NVIDIA built CUDA: a full-stack, reliable, developer-friendly suite. AMD and Intel lag far behind, with weaker or fragmented software support.

That’s why NVIDIA owns ~92% of the AI market. Not because their hardware is 10x better—but because their solution is.

Bottom line: CUDA—not the chip—is the real moat. Hardware can be copied. A 15-year software and community lead? Much harder.

##############################################

Nvidia and Microsoft

If NVIDIA’s real strength is in software—not just silicon—then its true peer isn’t AMD or Intel.

It’s Microsoft.

Here’s why:

Recurring Revenue: AMD sells chips. NVIDIA is shifting to software licenses like AI Enterprise—just like Microsoft did with Office and Azure. It’s predictable, high-margin income.

Developer Ecosystem: Microsoft owns developers with VS Code and GitHub. NVIDIA owns AI developers with CUDA. It’s the same playbook—control the tools, and you control the future.

Platform Effect: Microsoft has Windows and Azure. NVIDIA is building Omniverse and DGX Cloud—AI-native platforms others build on.

So don’t think of NVIDIA as just a chip company. Think of it as a platform company—executing Microsoft’s strategy in the AI era, and executing it brilliantly.

Veblen Good

Before we dive into our next hypothesis, let’s pause and consider a strange but powerful economic idea.

Usually, when prices go up, demand falls. But what if, for some products, the opposite happens?

Welcome to the world of Veblen goods—where price is the product.

Named after economist Thorstein Veblen, these are luxury items—Ferraris, Rolexes, high-fashion bags—where rising prices actually fuel more demand.

Why? Because it’s not just about utility. It’s about status. It’s “conspicuous consumption.” The buyer isn’t buying the thing—they’re buying what the thing says about them.

In this world, scarcity signals prestige. Lower the price, and you kill the appeal.

Now, with that in mind, let’s ask a bold question:

Is NVIDIA’s explosive growth also driven by this scarcity effect?
Not just demand—but the desire to be seen using the rarest, most powerful, most expensive compute on Earth?

Let’s explore
##############################################
H100 Availablity

So, let’s test our hypothesis:
Is NVIDIA’s growth really being supercharged by scarcity, just like a Veblen good?

For that to hold, the scarcity has to be real—not just hype.

And it is real.
This isn’t marketing fluff. Don’t take my word for it—just look at what analysts were saying just a few months ago.

Take this headline from April:

“A Silent Crisis Threatening Enterprise AI Plans.”

A crisis. Not a delay, not a hiccup—a crisis.
That means Fortune 500 companies—after betting billions on AI—are seeing their entire roadmaps stall.

Why?
Because they can’t get the chips.
Lead times for the H100 are now 6 to 12 months.

If you’re a major player ordering today, you might not get your GPUs until mid-2026.
In AI years, that’s ancient history.

And here’s the kicker:
This scarcity doesn’t just reflect demand—it creates global FOMO.
The H100 becomes more than just hardware.
It’s a status symbol. A golden ticket.
Proof that you’re serious about leading the AI race.

That’s scarcity economics in action.

###############################################################
NVIDIA ALLOCATION 


Now, let’s take that scarcity idea one step further.

Because NVIDIA isn’t just responding to demand—they’re shaping it through their allocation strategy.

Here’s how it works:
NVIDIA doesn’t just ship H100s on a first-come, first-served basis. They actively control who gets the chips—and why.

Let’s say Azure requests 10,000 H100s.
If those chips are for general cloud use, that’s one thing.
But if Azure says, “These 10,000 are for Inflection AI”—a hot startup with top-tier founders—that changes everything.

NVIDIA pays close attention to the end customer, not just the middleman.
If you’re a high-profile startup, or a Fortune 500 brand pushing AI boundaries, NVIDIA is far more likely to allocate chips your way—even above others who asked earlier.

This creates a dynamic that feels a lot like artificial scarcity.
Not all demand is treated equally.
Scarcity isn’t just about supply—it’s also about curation.

NVIDIA is effectively saying:

“We’re not just selling chips—we’re choosing who gets to build the future.”

And in doing so, they’re reinforcing their moat.
They’re not just a hardware company. They’re the gatekeepers of the AI revolution.


###############################################################
Resale and Cloud Rental 


So now that we’ve understood NVIDIA’s allocation strategy, let’s examine the real-world financial impact of that scarcity.

This slide captures how supply constraints translated directly into economic distortions, both in the resale market and the cloud rental market.

🔹 On the left, we have the resale pricing surge.
The H100’s MSRP is roughly $25,000.
But due to extreme demand and limited availability, resale prices exploded to over $40,000 per chip.
That’s a 60% markup—companies weren’t just buying GPUs, they were bidding for access. This pricing pressure turned the H100 into the equivalent of a scarce commodity—almost like oil or real estate.

🔹 On the right, we look at cloud rental trends, which reflect how companies accessed H100s without owning them.
At the height of the GPU shortage in mid-2023, rental rates soared to over $8 per hour per H100.
And here’s the kicker: it wasn’t just short-term usage.
Desperate for compute, AI startups and even large enterprises prepaid for months, locking in rates just to guarantee access.
This gave cloud providers a windfall—they turned chip scarcity into recurring, high-margin contracts.

As supply started improving later in 2023 and into 2024, we saw these rates gradually normalize. But the value had already been captured.
Long-term contracts were signed. Market power was exercised.

So the key takeaway?
The scarcity wasn’t just about technical bottlenecks—it became a financial weapon.
NVIDIA and its partners didn’t just ride the wave—they engineered the surfboard.

MARGIN

So far, we’ve walked through how NVIDIA engineered scarcity, controlled distribution through cloud providers, and built a software moat around CUDA and DGX bundles.

Now let’s look at the final outcome of all those strategies — profitability. This chart clearly lays out how the three major chipmakers compare when it comes to gross margins.

At the top, we have NVIDIA, sitting at a staggering 76% gross margin. This is a number you typically associate with dominant software businesses — not hardware manufacturers. But that’s exactly the point: NVIDIA isn’t just selling silicon. It’s selling an entire platform, where the real value comes from scarcity economics, CUDA lock-in, and bundled solutions like DGX systems.

AMD, despite producing high-performance GPUs, just can’t match this. Without CUDA and the ecosystem lock-in, AMD’s GPUs are far more interchangeable — and so are treated more like a commodity. That’s why AMD’s gross margin is significantly lower, at around 50%.

At the bottom is Intel, with a 43% gross margin — a reflection of their heavy dependence on CPUs, which are now heavily commoditized and under pressure from all sides, including NVIDIA’s own GPUs in AI workloads.

So what does this chart really show? It shows that NVIDIA’s strategy isn’t just winning technologically — it’s financially superior. While rivals fight on price and volume, NVIDIA is playing a different game altogether: one where control, ecosystem, and exclusivity drive elite-level profitability



####################################################

in conclusion While demand for AI chips is real, NVIDIA’s margins and growth are disproportionately high due to an engineered scarcity play. With limited supply, selective partnerships, and control over foundational software like CUDA, NVIDIA isn't just selling chips — it's creating digital luxury
