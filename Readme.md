# 🎥 NVIDIA Case Study: How Scarcity Drives Billion-Dollar Profits

Welcome to the official repository of the **NVIDIA Artificial Scarcity Case Study** — a deep dive into how NVIDIA strategically used GPU scarcity, software bundling, and its CUDA moat to dominate the AI hardware market and deliver record-breaking profits.

---

## 📌 Overview

This case study was created over **28 hours** as an end-to-end storytelling and analytical project. Inspired by the narrative-driven approach of **Think School**, the project combines:

- 📊 **Power BI** for interactive financial visualizations  
- 🎙️ **Google Gemini TTS** for human-like narration  
- 📽️ **Microsoft PowerPoint** for storytelling visuals  

The goal? To explain **how NVIDIA turned product scarcity into a weapon for pricing power and profitability**, with direct implications on AMD, Intel, and the AI hardware space at large.
